# Internal crowdfunding

When you need to generate new ideas and evaluate them, internal crowdfunding is a nice way to go. 

* The first stage is when people submit their ideas. Then you have to evaluate each idea and bring it lean canvas format.

* When you have the list of your ideas is time for the voting stage. Every participant has a budget of 100 imaginary coins and my invest in his favorite ideas.

* The idea with most funds wins!

# Internal crowdfunding voting

You can use this frontend for the funding stage. I used couchdb with two simple functions for organizing the data before displaying it.

Good luck
